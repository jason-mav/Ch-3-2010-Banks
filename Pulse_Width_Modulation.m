% Theory
% Pulse Width Modulation
% Pulse-width modulation (PWM), or pulse-duration modulation (PDM) is a modulation technique that conforms
% the width of the pulse, formally the pulse duration, based on a modulator signal information. Although this modulation 
% technique can be used to encode information for transmission, its main use is to allow the control of the power supplied
% to electrical devices, especially to inertial loads such as motors. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the 
% load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast pace. The longer the switch is on 
% compared to the off periods, the higher the power supplied to the load is.
% The PWM switching frequency has to be much faster than what would affect the load, which is to say the device that
% uses the power. Typically switchings have to be done several times a minute in an electric stove, 120 Hz in a lamp
% dimmer, from few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz for a motor drive and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio
% amplifiers and computer power supplies.
% The term duty cycle describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle
% corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, 100%
% being fully on.
% The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low. When a switch is off there is
% practically no current, and when it is on, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the
% product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which,
% because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle.
% PWM has also been used in certain communication systems where its duty cycle has been used to convey information over a 
% communications channel.
